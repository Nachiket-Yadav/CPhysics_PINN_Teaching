# CPhysics_PINN_Teaching
Teaching project about PINNs for PHY 329

The goal of this project is to give an introduction to Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). First we introduce the basic idea of neural networks and then elaborate on how PINNs are different from them.

If you prefer not to spend time adding extensions to your coding environment the notebook can be run as is on Google Colab (some installation steps will take time).
If you want to run it on your local machine VSCode is recommended. You will require the Julia extension and Julia itself installed on your machine. Creating a new python environment is also recommended.
